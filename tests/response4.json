{"statusCode": 200, "body": "\"\\nIn the context you provided, \\\"function\\\" refers to a mathematical concept that describes a relationship between inputs and outputs. A function takes an input value (also known as a \\\"variable\\\") and produces an output value, based on a specific set of rules or equations.\\n\\nIn the given scenario, the math teacher is writing a \\\"function\\\" on the blackboard. This implies that the teacher is defining a mathematical expression or equation that establishes a relationship between two variables. The function could be a linear function, a quadratic function, a polynomial function, or any other mathematical function.\\n\\nBy writing a function on the blackboard, the math teacher is demonstrating to the students how to manipulate variables and solve problems using mathematical functions. This can help students understand the concept of functions and apply them in real-world scenarios.\""}
